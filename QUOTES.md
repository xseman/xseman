“I learned a painful lesson, that for small programs dynamic typing is great,  
for large programs you have to have a more disciplined approach and it helps if  
the language actually gives you that discipline, rather than telling you 'Well  
you can do whatever you want'. I found TypeScript is actually incredibly useful,  
so we're adding a similar idea to Python, we're adding it in a slightly  
different way because we have different context ... I thought dynamic languages  
were easier to approach because you haven't got types that are this bother all  
the time. Well it turns out that you can actually be more productive by having  
types if you do it in a non-intrusive manner and if you work hard doing good  
type inference and so forth.“  
― Guido van Rossum (April, 2019)
