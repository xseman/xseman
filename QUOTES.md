I learned a painful lesson, that for small programs dynamic typing is great,\
for large programs you have to have a more disciplined approach and it helps if\
the language actually gives you that discipline, rather than telling you 'Well\
you can do whatever you want'. I found TypeScript is actually incredibly useful,\
so we're adding a similar idea to Python, we're adding it in a slightly\
different way because we have different context ... I thought dynamic languages\
were easier to approach because you haven't got types that are this bother all\
the time. Well it turns out that you can actually be more productive by having\
types if you do it in a non-intrusive manner and if you work hard doing good\
type inference and so forth.\
