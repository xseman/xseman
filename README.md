### Hello, Friend ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Filip**, I'm curious eternal student interested in software and 
development. The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I 
know nothing. I try to delete more code than I write. 

### My work ðŸ§—

I do all this in my free time from my main job. The current main areas of my
specialization are `Web` development, `TypeScript`, modern `JavaScript`
and `CSS`, `docker`, `C`, `Golang`, `Linux`, `automation`, `bash` and `CLI`.
